Geospatial Data Model Standards
====================================

The various elements such as Station Benchmark, Station Site Survey, Hydrological Cross Section, etc, shall be collected using the Geospatial Data Model Standards. The data associated with the polyline elements shall be as indicated below for the respective elements constructed, with the date of installation, (month and year) being provided for all new work materials. 

All collected data shall be coordinated with RATES using  the means and methods for achieving the end results for the data indicated in the Geospatial Data Model Standard.

The data collection for the new project work areas shall be consistent for the same types of entities in each location. 

The Geospatial Data shall represent the feature being identified to the level of 1 centimeter and 2-centimeter accuracy for the horizontal and vertical coordinate, respectively. A geodatabase template for all required features and associated data will be provided to, and be used.

Data will be collected using FEMA Data Capture- Workflow Details.
